# mathSetupCalc
A very simple java program to calculate things with steps shown
User is shown a few options 
  1 Solve a quadratic equation
  2 Prime number calculator
  3 Factorial calculator [n]!
  4 Right triangle calculator
The idea is to show the user steps not just the solution 
There is a few things that could be improved, maybe additional work on the quadratic equation.
